GENERAL INTRODUCTION

       *       *       *       *       *

Books are as much a part of the furnishing of a house as tables and
chairs, and in the making of a home they belong, not with the luxuries
but with the necessities. A bookless house is not a home; for a home
affords food and shelter for the mind as well as for the body. It is
as great an offence against a child to starve his mind as to starve
his body, and there is as much danger of reducing his vitality and
putting him at a disadvantage in his lifework in the one as in the
other form of deprivation. There was a time when it was felt that
shelter, clothing, food and physical oversight comprised the whole
duty of a charitable institution to dependent children; to-day no
community would permit such an institution to exist unless it provided
school privileges. An acute sense of responsibility toward children
is one of the prime characteristics of American society, shown in the
vast expenditures for public education in all forms, in the increasing
attention paid to light, ventilation, and safety in school buildings,
in the opening of play grounds in large cities, in physical
supervision of children in schools, and the agitation against the
employment of children in factories, and in other and less obvious
ways.

Children are helpless to protect themselves and secure what they need
for health of body and mind; they are exceedingly impressionable; and
the future is always in their hands. The first and most imperative
duty of parents is to give their children the best attainable
preparation for life, no matter at what sacrifice to themselves. There
are hosts of fathers and mothers who recognize this obligation but do
not know how to discharge it; who are eager to give their children the
most wholesome conditions, but do not know how to secure them; who are
especially anxious that their children should start early and start
right on that highway of education which is the open road to honorable
success. There are many homes in which books would find abundant room
if the heads of the families knew what books to buy, or had the means
to put into the hands of the growing child the reading matter it needs
in the successive periods of its growth.

This condition of eagerness to give the best, and of ignorance of how
or where to find the best is the justification for the publication
of this set of books. The attempt has been made in a series of twelve
volumes to bring together in convenient form the fairy stories, myths,
and legends which have fed the children of many generations in the
years when the imagination is awakening and craving stimulus and
material to work upon;--that age of myth-making which is a prelude to
the more scientific uses of the mind and of immense importance in an
intensely practical age;--a group of tales of standard quality and
an interest and value which have placed them among the permanent
possessions of English literature; a careful selection of stories
of animal life; a natural history, familiar in style and thoroughly
trustworthy in fact; an account of those travels and adventures which
have opened up the earth and made its resources available, and which
constitute one of the most heroic chapters in the history of the
long struggle of men to possess the earth and make it a home for
the highest kind of civilization; a record of heroism taken from the
annals of the patriots and of those brave men who, in all ages, ranks
of society and occupations, have dared to face great dangers in the
path of duty and science, with special attention to that everyday
heroism in which the age is specially rich and of which so many good
people are grossly ignorant; a survey of scientific achievement, with
reports of recent discoveries in knowledge and adaptation of knowledge
to human need; a group of biographies of the men and women--mostly
Americans--who are the most stimulating companions for boys and girls;
a volume on the Fine Arts dealing with music, painting, sculpture,
architecture, in a way to instruct young readers and making accessible
a large number of those songs which appeal in the best way to children
in schools and homes; a collection of the best poetry for the youngest
and oldest readers, chosen not only for excellence from the standpoint
of art, but deep and abiding human interest; and a volume devoted to
the occupations and resources of the home, addressed to parents no
less than to children, with practical suggestions about books and
reading, games and amusements, exercise and health, and those kindred
topics which have to do with making the home wholesome and attractive.

These twelve volumes aim, in brief, to make the home the most
inspiring school and the most attractive place for pleasure, and
to bring the best the world has to offer of adventure, heroism,
achievement and beauty within its four walls.

Special attention has been given to the youngest children whose
interests are often neglected because they are thought to be too
immature to receive serious impressions from what is read to them.
Psychology is beginning to make us understand that no greater
mistake can be made in the education of children than underrating the
importance of the years when the soil receives the seed most quickly.
For education of the deepest sort--the planting of those formative
ideas which give final direction and quality to the intellectual
life--there is no period so important as the years between three and
six, and none so fruitful. To put in the seed at that time is, as a
rule, to decide the kind of harvest the child will reap later; whether
he shall be a shrewd, keen, clever, ambitious man, with a hard,
mechanical mind, bent on getting the best of the world; or a generous,
fruitful, open-minded man, intent on living the fullest life in mind
and heart. No apology is offered for giving large space to myths,
legends, fairy stories, tales of all sorts, and to poetry; for in
these expressions of the creative mind is to be found the material on
which the imagination has fed in every age and which is, for the most
part, conspicuously absent from our educational programmes.

America has at present greater facility in producing "smart" men than
in producing able men; the alert, quick-witted, money-maker abounds,
but the men who live with ideas, who care for the principles
of things, and who make life rich in resource and interest are
comparatively few. America needs poetry more than it needs industrial
training; though the two ought never to be separated. The time to
awaken the imagination, which is the creative faculty, is early
childhood; and the most accessible material for this education is the
literature which the race created in its childhood. The creative man,
whether in the arts or in practical affairs, in poetry, in engineering
or in business, is always the man of imagination.

In this library for young people the attempt has been made not only
to give the child what it needs but in the form which is most easily
understood. For this reason some well-known stories have been
retold in simpler English than their classic forms present. This is
especially true of many tales for any young children reprinted by
special arrangement from recent English sources. In some cases, where
the substance has seemed of more importance to the child than the
form, simpler words and forms of expression have been substituted for
more complex or abstract phrases, and passages of minor importance
have been condensed or omitted.

The aim in making the selections in this set of books has been to
interest the child and give it what it needs for normal growth; the
material has been taken from many sources old and new; much of the
reading matter presented has been familiar in one form or another, to
generations of children; much has appeared for the first time within
the last ten years; a considerable part has been prepared especially
for the Treasury and a large part has been selected from the best
writing in the various fields.

It is the hope of the Editor that this "Treasury" or "Library" will
justify its title by its real and fundamental service to children and
parents alike.

INTRODUCTION


Since this series of books is intended for all young people from one
to one hundred, it opens with about eighty of the old MOTHER GOOSE
RHYMES. Nothing better was ever invented to tell to little folks who
are young enough for lullabies. Their rhythm, their humor, and their
pith will always cause us to prize them as the Babies' Classics.

Next come a score of the most famous NURSERY TALES, the kind that
children cry for and love to hear fifty times over. And since, just
as soon as little folks like stories they love to hear them in rhyme,
here are forty CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS.

What would young life be without "Puss in Boots" and "Little Red
Riding Hood" and "The Sleeping Beauty"? Our TREASURY would indeed be
poor without them, so these FAVORITE STORIES come next, yoked
with some OLD-FASHIONED POEMS in story-form, as "The Night before
Christmas," "The Wonderful World," and "Little Orphant Annie." All who
love pets and animals have always liked FABLES, so here are the noted
parables of Æsop, and the lesser-known but even more jolly tales from
East Indian sources.

The fairy-tale age is supposed to come from four to nine, but the
editors are sure it lasts much longer than that. However this may be,
the better half of our first volume is given up to FAIRY TALES AND
LAUGHTER STORIES from all over the world.

It ends with TALES FOR TINY TOTS, the kind that mother reads beside
the fire at bedtime, some of them old, like the "Little Red Hen" and
"Peter Rabbit," and some of them newer, like "The Greedy Brownie" and
"The Birthday Honors of the Fairy Queen."

  Hush-a-bye, baby, on the tree-top,
  When the wind blows the cradle will rock;
  When the bough breaks the cradle will fall,
  Down will come baby, bough, cradle, and all.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Rock-a-bye, baby, thy cradle is green;
  Father's a nobleman, mother's a Queen;
  Betty's a lady, and wears a gold ring;
  And Johnny's a drummer, and drums for the King.

  Bye, baby bunting,
  Daddy's gone a-hunting,
  To get a little rabbit-skin,
  To wrap his baby bunting in.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Hush thee, my babby,
  Lie still with thy daddy,
  Thy mammy has gone to the mill,
    To grind thee some wheat
    To make thee some meat,
  And so, my dear babby, lie still.

       *       *       *       *       *

      Sleep, baby, sleep!
    Thy father watches the sheep;
  Thy mother is shaking the dream-land tree,
  And down falls a little dream on thee:
      Sleep, baby, sleep!

      Sleep, baby, sleep.
    The large stars are the sheep,
  The wee stars are the lambs, I guess,
  The fair moon is the shepherdess:
      Sleep, baby, sleep!

  Put it in the oven for Tommy and me.

    Who lives in the lane.

  She shall have music wherever she goes.

  Bobby Shaftoe's gone to sea,
  Silver buckles on his knee;

  Tom, he was a piper's son,
  He learned to play when he was young,
  And all the tune that he could play
  Was, "Over the hills and far away,"
  Over the hills, and a great way off,
  The wind will blow my top-knot off.

  Now, Tom with his pipe made such a noise
  That he well pleased both the girls and boys,
  And they always stopped to hear him play
    "Over the hills and far away."

       *       *       *       *       *

  Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home,
  Thy house is on fire, thy children all gone:

  The north wind doth blow,
  And we shall have snow,
  And what will the robin do then,
            Poor thing?

  He'll sit in a barn,
  And keep himself warm,
  And hide his head under his wing,
            Poor thing!

  I had a little pony,
  His name was Dapple-gray,
  I lent him to a lady,
    To ride a mile away;
  She whipped him, she lashed him,
    She rode him through the mire;
  I would not lend my pony now
    For all the lady's hire.

  Simple Simon met a pieman,
    Going to the fair;
  Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
    "Let me taste your ware."

  Says the pieman to Simple Simon,
    "Show me first your penny."
  Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
    "Indeed I have not any."

  Simple Simon went a-fishing
    For to catch a whale;
  But all the water he could find
    Was in his mother's pail!

    And Jill came tumbling after.

  Up Jack got and home did trot
    As fast as he could caper;
  Went to bed to mend his head
    With vinegar and brown paper.

  Jill came in and she did grin,
    To see his paper plaster,
  Mother, vexed, did whip her next,
    For causing Jack's disaster.

  Old Mother Goose, when
    She wanted to wander,
  Would ride through the air
    On a very fine gander.

  Mother Goose had a house,
    'T was built in a wood,
  Where an owl at the door
    For sentinel stood.

  She had a son Jack,
    A plain-looking lad;
  He was not very good,
    Nor yet very bad.

  She sent him to market,
   A live goose he bought:
  "Here! mother," says he,
    "It will not go for nought."

  Jack's goose and her gander
    Grew very fond;
  They'd both eat together,
    Or swim in one pond.

  Jack found one morning,
    As I have been told,
  His goose had laid him
    An egg of pure gold.

  Jack rode to his mother,
    The news for to tell.
  She called him a good boy,
    And said it was well.

  Goosey, goosey, gander,
    Where shall I wander?

  There I met an old man
    Who would not say his prayers;
  I took him by the left leg,
    And threw him downstairs.

  There was a crooked man,
    And he went a crooked mile,
  He found a crooked sixpence
    Upon a crooked stile:
  He bought a crooked cat,
    That caught a crooked mouse--

    In a little crooked house.

  There was a man in our town,

  He jumped into another bush,
    And scratched 'em in again.

  I saw a ship a-sailing,
  A-sailing on the sea;
  And it was full of pretty things
  For baby and for me.

  There were sweetmeats in the cabin,
  And apples in the hold;
  The sails were made of silk,
  And the masts were made of gold.

  The four-and-twenty sailors
  That stood between the decks,
  Were four-and-twenty white mice.
  With chains about their necks.

  The captain was a duck,
  With a packet on his back;
  And when the ship began to move,
  The captain cried, "Quack, quack!"

    My dear, do you know,
    How a long time ago,
      Two poor little children,
    Whose names I don't know,
  Were stolen away on a fine summer's day,
  And left in a wood, as I've heard people say.

    And when it was night,
    So sad was their plight!
      The sun it went down,
    And the moon gave no light!
  They sobbed and they sighed, and they bitterly cried
  And the poor little things, they lay down and died.

    And when they were dead,
    The robins so red,
      Brought strawberry-leaves
    And over them spread;
      And all the day long,
      They sung them this song:
  "Poor babes in the wood! Poor babes in the wood!
  Oh don't you remember the babes in the wood?"

       *       *       *       *       *

  The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts
    All on a summer's day;
  The Knave of Hearts, he stole the tarts,
    And took them clean away.

  The King of Hearts called for the tarts,
    And beat the Knave full sore;
  The Knave of Hearts brought back the tarts,
    And vowed he'd steal no more.

  I had a little husband,
    No bigger than my thumb;
  I put him in a pint-pot,
    And there I bade him drum.

  I bought a little horse,
    That galloped up and down;
  I bridled him, and saddled
    And sent him out of town.

  I gave him little garters,
    To garter up his hose,
  And a little handkerchief,
    To wipe his little nose.

  Sing a song of sixpence,
    A pocket full of rye;
  Four-and-twenty blackbirds
    Baked in a pie;

  When the pie was opened
    The birds began to sing;
  Was not that a dainty dish
    To set before the King?

  The King was in his counting-house,
    Counting out his money;
  The Queen was in the parlor,
    Eating bread and honey;

  The maid was in the garden
    Hanging out the clothes;
  When up came a blackbird,
    And nipped off her nose.

  Little Bo-peep, she lost her sheep,
    And can't tell where to find them;
  Leave them alone, and they'll come home,
    And bring their tails behind them.

  Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,
    And dreamed she heard them bleating;
  When she awoke she found it a joke,
    For they still were all fleeting.

  Then up she took her little crook,
    Determined for to find them;
  She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
    For they'd left their tails behind them!

  It happened one day, as Bo-peep did stray,
    Unto a meadow hard by--
  There she espied their tails side by side,
    All hung on a tree to dry.

  She heaved a sigh, and wiped her eye,
    And over the hillocks she raced;
  And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,
    That each tail should be properly placed.

  What are little girls made of?
  Sugar and spice, and all that's nice;
  And that's what little girls are made of, made of.

    Upon his gray mare;
  Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
  With his daughter behind him,
    So rosy and fair;
  Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

  A raven cried "Croak";
    And they all tumbled down;
  Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
  The mare broke her knees,
    And the farmer his crown;
  Lumpety, lumpety, lump.

  The mischievous raven
    Flew laughing away;
  Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
  And vowed he would serve them
    The same the next day;
  Bumpety, bumpety, bump!

WHAT DOES LITTLE BIRDIE SAY?

  What does little birdie say,
  In her nest at peep of day?
    "Let me fly," says little birdie,
  "Mother, let me fly away."

  Birdie, rest a little longer,
  Till the little wings are stronger.
  So she rests a little longer,
    Then she flies away.

  What does little baby say,
  In her bed at peep of day?
    Baby says, like little birdie,
  "Let me rise and fly away."

  Baby, sleep a little longer,
  Till the little limbs are stronger.
  If she sleeps a little longer,
    Baby, too, shall fly away.

GOOD NIGHT

  Little baby, lay your head
  On your pretty cradle-bed;
  Shut your eye-peeps, now the day
  And the light are gone away;
  All the clothes are tucked in tight;
  Little baby dear, good night.

  Yes, my darling, well I know
  How the bitter wind doth blow;
  And the winter's snow and rain
  Patter on the window-pane:
  But they cannot come in here,
  To my little baby dear;

  For the window shutteth fast,
  Till the stormy night is past;
  And the curtains warm are spread
  Round about her cradle-bed:
  So till morning shineth bright,
  Little baby dear, good night.

  Sweet and low, sweet and low,
    Wind of the western sea,
  Low, low, breathe and blow,
    Wind of the western sea!
  Over the rolling waters go,
  Come from the dying moon, and blow,
    Blow him again to me:
  While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.

  Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,
    Father will come to thee soon;
  Rest, rest, on mother's breast,
    Father will come to thee soon;
  Father will come to his babe in the nest,
  Silver sails all out of the west
    Under the silver moon:
  Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.

BABY-LAND

  Which is the way to Baby-Land?
    Any one can tell;
      Up one flight,
      To your right;
    Please to ring the bell.

  What can you see in Baby-Land?
    Little folks in white,
      Downy heads,
      Cradle-beds,
    Faces pure and bright.

  What do they do in Baby-Land?
    Dream and wake and play,
      Laugh and crow,
      Shout and grow,
    Jolly times have they.

  What do they say in Baby-Land?
    Why, the oddest things;
      Might as well
      Try to tell
    What a birdie sings.

  Who is the Queen of Baby-Land?
    Mother kind and sweet;
      And her love,
      Born above,
    Guides the little feet.

  Old Mother Hubbard, she went to the cupboard,
    To get her poor dog a bone.
  When she got there, the cupboard was bare,
    And so the poor dog had none.

  She went to the baker's to buy him some bread,
  But when she came back the poor dog was dead.

  She went to the undertaker's to buy him a coffin,
  And when she came back the dog was laughing.

  She went to the draper's to buy him some linen,
  And when she came back the good dog was spinning.

  She went to the hosier's to buy him some hose,
  And when she came back he was dressed in his clothes.

  The dame made a curtsy, the dog made a bow,
  The dame said "your servant," the dog said "Bow-wow."

  She went to the hatter's to buy him a hat,
  And when she came back he was feeding the cat.

  She went to the tailor's to buy him a coat,
  And when she came back he was riding the goat.

  She went to the barber's to buy him a wig,
  And when she came back he was dancing a jig.

  She went to the butcher's to get him some tripe,
  And when she came back he was smoking a pipe.

  She went to the fish-shop to buy him some fish,
  And when she came back he was washing the dish.

  She went to the tavern for white wine and red,
  And when she came back the dog stood on his head.

POLLY

  Brown eyes, straight nose;
  Dirt pies, rumpled clothes.

  Torn books, spoilt toys:
  Arch looks, unlike a boy's;

  Little rages, obvious arts;
  (Three her age is), cakes, tarts;

  Falling down off chairs;
  Breaking crown down stairs;

  Catching flies on the pane;
  Deep sighs--cause not plain;

  Bribing you with kisses
  For a few farthing blisses.

  Wide-a-wake; as you hear,
  "Mercy's sake, quiet, dear!"

  New shoes, new frock;
  Vague views of what's o'clock

  When it's time to go to bed,
  And scorn sublime for what is said

  Folded hands, saying prayers,
  Understands not nor cares--

  Thinks it odd, smiles away;
  Yet may God hear her pray!

  Bed gown white, kiss Dolly;
  Good night!--that's Polly,

  Fast asleep, as you see,
  Heaven keep my girl for me!

CRADLE HYMN

  Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber;
    Holy angels guard thy bed;
  Heavenly blessings without number
    Gently falling on thy head.

  Sleep, my babe, thy food and raiment,
    House and home, thy friends provide;
  All without thy care, or payment,
    All thy wants are well supplied.

  How much better thou'rt attended
    Than the Son of God could be,
  When from heaven He descended,
    And became a child like thee!

  Soft and easy is thy cradle;
    Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay,
  When His birthplace was a stable,
    And His softest bed was hay.

  See the kindly shepherds round him,
    Telling wonders from the sky!
  When they sought Him, there they found Him,
    With his Virgin-Mother by.

  See the lovely babe a-dressing;
    Lovely infant, how He smiled!
  When He wept, the mother's blessing
    Soothed and hushed the holy child.

  Lo, He slumbers in His manger,
    Where the honest oxen fed;
  --Peace, my darling! here's no danger!
    Here's no ox a-near thy bed!

  Mayst thou live to know and fear Him,
    Trust and love Him all thy days;
  Then go dwell forever near Him,
    See His face, and sing His praise!

  I could give thee thousand kisses,
    Hoping what I most desire;
  Not a mother's fondest wishes
    Can to greater joys aspire.

I LIKE LITTLE PUSSY

  I like little Pussy,
    Her coat is so warm;
  And if I don't hurt her
    She'll do me no harm.
  So I'll not pull her tail,
    Nor drive her away,
  But Pussy and I
    Very gently will play;
  She shall sit by my side,
    And I'll give her some food;
  And she'll love me because
    I am gentle and good.

  I'll pat little Pussy,
    And then she will purr,
  And thus show her thanks
    For my kindness to her;
  I'll not pinch her ears,
    Nor tread on her paw,
  Lest I should provoke her
    To use her sharp claw;
  I never will vex her,
    Nor make her displeased,
  For Pussy can't bear
    To be worried or teased.

  Pussy-cat said naught but "Mew," and Robin flew away.

SLEEP, MY TREASURE

    Sleep, sleep, my treasure,
    The long day's pleasure
  Has tired the birds, to their nests they creep;
    The garden still is
    Alight with lilies,
  But all the daisies are fast asleep.

    Sleep, sleep, my darling,
    Dawn wakes the starling,
  The sparrow stirs when he sees day break;
    But all the meadow
    Is wrapped in shadow,
  And you must sleep till the daisies wake!

LULLABY OF AN INFANT CHIEF

  Oh, hush thee, my babie, thy sire was a knight,
  Thy mother a lady, both lovely and bright;
  The woods and the glens from the tower which we see,
  They all are belonging, dear babie, to thee.

  Oh, fear not the bugle, though loudly it blows,
  It calls but the warders that guard thy repose;
  Their bows would be bended, their blades would be red,
  Ere the step of a foeman draws near to thy bed.

  Oh, hush thee, my babie, the time will soon come,
  When thy sleep shall be broken by trumpet and drum;
  Then hush thee, my darling, take rest while you may,
  For strife comes with manhood, and waking with day.

THE ORPHAN'S SONG

  I had a little bird,
    I took it from the nest;
  I prest it and blest it,
    And nurst it in my breast.

  I set it on the ground,
  Danced round and round,
  And sang about it so cheerly,
    With "Hey, my little bird,
    And ho! my little bird,
  And oh! but I love thee dearly!"

  I make a little feast
    Of food soft and sweet,
  I hold it in my breast,
    And coax it to eat;

  I pit, and I pat,
  I call this and that,
  And I sing about so cheerly,
    With "Hey, my little bird,
    And ho! my little bird,
  And oh! but I love thee dearly!"

  I'll sing his dirge."

  Far away from winter snow
  To the fair, warm South they go;
  There they stay till daisies blow,

  Where do all the babies go?

  In the glancing firelight warm,
  Safely sheltered from all harm,
  Soft they lie on mother's arm,
      That is where they go!

THE THREE BEARS


Little Goldilocks was a pretty girl who lived once upon a time in a
far-off country.

One day she was sitting on the hearthrug playing with her two kittens,
and you would have thought she was as happy as a queen, and quite
contented to stay where she was instead of wanting to run about the
world meddling with other people's property. But it happened that she
was rather a mischievous little maid, and could not resist teasing her
pets, so one of them scratched her, and then she would play with them
no longer.

She got up and trotted away into the wood behind her mother's house,
and it was such a warm, pleasant day that she wandered on and on until
she came into a part of the wood where she had never been before.

Now, in this wood there lived a family of three Bears. The first was
a GREAT BIG BEAR, the second was a MIDDLING-SIZED BEAR, and the third
was a LITTLE TEENY TINY BEAR, and they all lived together in a funny
little house, and very happy they were.

Goldilocks stopped when she came to the Bears' house, and began to
wonder who lived there.

"I'll just look in and see," she said, and so she did; but there
was no one there, for the Bears had all gone out for a morning walk,
whilst the soup they were going to have for dinner cooled upon the
table.

Goldilocks was rather hungry after her walk, and the soup smelt so
good that she began to wish the people of the house would come home
and invite her to have some. But although she looked everywhere, under
the table and into the cupboards, she could find no one, and at last
she could resist no longer, but made up her mind to take just a little
sip to see how the soup tasted. The soup had been put into three
bowls--a Great Big Bowl for the Great Big Bear, a Middling-sized Bowl
for the Middling-sized Bear, and a Teeny Tiny Bowl for the Teeny Tiny
Bear; beside each bowl lay a spoon, and Goldilocks took one and helped
herself to a spoonful of soup from the Great Big Bowl.

Ugh! how it burnt her mouth; it was so hot with pepper that she did
not like it at all; still, she was very hungry, so she thought she
would try again.

This time she took a sip of the Middling-sized Bear's soup, but she
liked that no better, for it was too salt. But when she tasted the
Teeny Tiny Bear's soup it was just as she liked it; so she ate it up
every drop, without thinking twice about it.

When she had finished her dinner she noticed three chairs standing by
the wall. One was a Great Big Chair, and she climbed upon that and sat
down. Oh, dear! how hard it was! She was sure she could not sit
there for long, so she climbed up on the next, which was only a
Middling-sized Chair, but that was too soft for her taste; so she went
on to the last, which was a Teeny Tiny Chair and suited her exactly.

It was so comfortable that she sat on and on until, if you'll
believe it, she actually sat the bottom out. Then, of course, she
was comfortable no longer, so she got up and began to wonder what she
should do next.

There was a staircase in the Bears' house, and Goldilocks thought she
would go up it and see where it led to. So up she went, and when she
reached the top she laughed outright, for the Bears' bedroom was the
funniest she had ever seen. In the middle of the room stood a Great
Big Bed, on one side of it there was a Middling-sized Bed, and on the
other side there was a Teeny Tiny Bed.

Goldilocks was sleepy, so she thought she would lie down and have a
little nap. First she got upon the Great Big Bed, but it was just as
hard as the Great Big Chair had been; so she jumped off and tried the
Middling-sized Bed, but it was so soft that she sank right down into
the feather cushions and was nearly smothered.

"I will try the Teeny Tiny Bed," she said, and so she did, and it was
so comfortable that she soon fell fast asleep.

Whilst she lay there, dreaming of all sorts of pleasant things, the
three Bears came home from their walk very hungry and quite ready for
their dinners.

But, oh! dear me! how cross the Great Big Bear looked when he saw his
spoon had been used and thrown under the table.

"WHO HAS BEEN TASTING MY SOUP?" he cried, in a Great Big Voice.

"AND WHO HAS BEEN TASTING MINE?" cried the Middling-sized Bear, in a
Middling-sized Voice.

"BUT WHO HAS BEEN TASTING MINE AND TASTED IT ALL UP?" cried the poor
little Teeny Tiny Bear in a Teeny Tiny Voice, with the tears running
down his Teeny Tiny Face.

When the Great Big Bear went to sit down in his Great Big Chair, he
cried out in his Great Big Voice:

"WHO HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY CHAIR?"

And the Middling-sized Bear cried, in a Middling-sized Voice:

"WHO HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY CHAIR?"

But the Teeny Tiny Bear cried out in a Teeny Tiny Voice of anger:

"WHO HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY CHAIR, AND SAT THE BOTTOM OUT?"

By this time the Bears were sure that someone had been in their house
quite lately; so they looked about to see if someone were not there
still.

There was certainly no one downstairs, so they went up the staircase
to their bedroom.

As soon as the Great Big Bear looked at his bed, he cried out, in his
Great Big Voice:

"WHO HAS BEEN LYING ON MY BED?"

And the Middling-sized Bear, seeing that the coverlet was all rumpled,
cried out, in a Middling-sized Voice:

"WHO HAS BEEN LYING ON MY BED?"

But the Teeny Tiny Bear cried out, in a Teeny Tiny Voice of
astonishment:

"WHO HAS BEEN LYING ON MY BED AND LIES THERE STILL?"

Now, when the Great Big Bear began to speak, Goldilocks dreamt that
there was a bee buzzing in the room, and when the Middling-sized Bear
began to speak, she dreamt that it was flying out of the window; but
when the Teeny Tiny Bear began to speak, she dreamt that the bee
had come back and stung her on the ear, and up she jumped. Oh! how
frightened she was when she saw the three Bears standing beside her.

She hopped out of bed and in a second was out through the open window.
Never stopping to wonder if the fall had hurt her, she got up and ran
and ran and ran until she could go no farther, always thinking that
the Bears were close behind her. And when at length she fell down in a
heap on the ground, because she was too tired to run any more, it was
her own mother who picked her up, because in her fright she had run
straight home without knowing it.

CINDERELLA


Once upon a time there lived a noble gentleman who had one dear little
daughter. Poor child! her own kind mother was dead, and her father,
who loved her very dearly, was afraid that his little girl was
sometimes lonely. So he married a grand lady who had two daughters
of her own, and who, he thought, would be kind and good to his little
one. But no sooner did the stepmother enter her new home than she
began to show her true character. Her stepdaughter was so much
prettier and sweeter than her own children, that she was jealous of
her, and gave her all the hard work of the house to do, whilst the two
proud sisters spent their time at pleasant parties and entertainments.

The only pleasure the poor child had was to spend her evenings sitting
in the chimney-corner, resting her weary limbs, and for this reason
her sisters mockingly nicknamed her "Cinderella." The sisters' fine
clothes made Cinderella feel very shabby; but, in her little torn
frock and ragged shoes, she was a thousand times more lovely than
they.

Now, it chanced that the King's son gave a grand ball, to which he
invited all the lords and ladies in the country, and, amongst the
rest, Cinderella's two sisters were asked. How pleased and excited
they were when the invitation arrived! For days they could talk of
nothing but the clothes they should wear and the grand folk they hoped
to meet.

When at last the great day arrived, Cinderella was kept running about
from early till late, decking the sisters, and dressing their hair.

"Don't you wish you were going to the ball?" said one of them.

"Indeed I do," sighed the poor little maid. The sisters burst out
laughing. "A pretty spectacle _you_ would be," they said rudely. "Go
back to your cinders--they are fit company for rags." Then, stepping
carefully into their carriage so that they might not crush their fine
clothes, they drove away to the ball.

Cinderella went back to her chimney-corner, and tried not to feel
envious, but the tears _would_ gather in the pretty eyes, and trickle
down the sorrowful little face.

"What are you crying for, child?" cried a silvery voice.

Cinderella started, and raised her eyes. Who could it be? Then in a
moment she knew--it was her fairy Godmother!

"I do so want----" began Cinderella; then her sobs stopped her.

"To go to the ball," finished the Godmother. Cinderella nodded. "Well,
leave off crying--be a good girl, and you shall go. Run quickly into
the garden, and bring the largest pumpkin you can find."

Cinderella could not imagine how a pumpkin could help her to go to the
ball, but her only thought was to obey her Godmother. In a few moments
she was back again, with a splendid pumpkin. Her Godmother scooped out
the inside--one touch of the wand, and the pumpkin was a golden coach,
lined with white satin.

"Now, godchild, quick--the mouse-trap from the pantry!"

"Here it is, Godmother," said Cinderella breathlessly.

One by one six fat sleek mice passed through the trap door. As each
appeared, a touch of the wand transformed it into a cream-colored
horse, fit for a queen.

"Now, Cinderella, can you find a coachman?"

"There is a large gray rat in the rat-trap--would he do, Godmother?"

"Run and fetch him, child, and then I can judge," So Cinderella ran to
fetch the rat, and her Godmother said he was just made for a coachman;
and I think you would have agreed with her had you seen him a moment
later, with his powdered wig and silk stockings.

Six lizards from behind the pumpkin-frame became six footmen in
splendid liveries--you would have thought they had been footmen all
their lives. Cinderella was so excited that she could scarcely speak.

"Oh! Godmother," she cried, "it is all so lovely!" Then suddenly she
thought of her shabby frock. "There is my white muslin," she said
wistfully, "if--do you think----"

But before Cinderella could realize what was happening, her
Godmother's wand tapped her lightly on the shoulder, and in place of
the shabby frock, there was a gleam of satin, silver, and pearls.

Ah! who can describe a robe made by the fairies? It was white as snow,
and as dazzling; round the hem hung a fringe of diamonds, sparkling
like dew-drops in the sunshine. The lace about the throat and arms
could only have been spun by fairy spiders. Surely it was a dream!
Cinderella put her daintily-gloved hand to her throat, and softly
touched the pearls that encircled her neck.

"Come, child," said the Godmother, "or you will be late."

As Cinderella moved, the firelight shone upon her dainty shoes.

"They are of diamonds," she said.

"No," answered her Godmother, smiling; "they are better than
that--they are of glass, made by the fairies. And now, child, go, and
enjoy yourself to your heart's content. Only remember, if you stay at
the palace one instant after midnight, your coach and servants will
vanish, and you will be the little gray Cinderella once more!"

A few moments later, the coach dashed into the royal courtyard, the
door was flung open, and Cinderella alighted. As she walked slowly up
the richly-carpeted staircase, there was a murmur of admiration, and
the King's son hastened to meet her. "Never," said he to himself,
"have I seen anyone so lovely!" He led her into the ball-room, where
the King, who was much taken with her sweet face and pretty, modest
manners, whispered to the Queen that she must surely be a foreign
Princess.

The evening passed away in a dream of delight, Cinderella dancing with
no one but the handsome young Prince, and being waited on by his own
hands at supper-time. The two sisters could not recognize their ragged
little sister in the beautiful and graceful lady to whom the Prince
paid so much attention, and felt quite pleased and flattered when she
addressed a few words to them.

Presently a clock chimed the three quarters past eleven, and,
remembering her Godmother's warning, Cinderella at once took leave of
the Prince, and, jumping into her coach, was driven rapidly home. Here
she found her Godmother waiting to hear all about the ball. "It was
_lovely_," said Cinderella; "and oh! Godmother, there is to be another
to-morrow night, and I _should_ so much like to go to it!"

"Then you shall," replied the kind fairy, and, kissing her godchild
tenderly, she vanished. When the sisters returned from the ball, they
found a sleepy little maiden sitting in the chimney-corner, waiting
for them.

"How late you are!" cried Cinderella, yawning. "Are you not very
tired?"

"Not in the least," they answered, and then they told her what a
delightful ball it had been, and how the loveliest Princess in the
world had been there, and had spoken to them, and admired their pretty
dresses.

"Who was she?" asked Cinderella slyly.

"That we cannot say," answered the sisters. "She would not tell her
name, though the Prince begged her to do so on bended knee."

"Dear sister," said Cinderella, "I, too, should like to see the
beautiful Princess. Will you not lend me your old yellow gown, that I
may go to the ball to-morrow with you?"

"What!" cried her sister angrily; "lend one of my dresses to a little
cinder-maid? Don't talk nonsense, child!"

The next night, the sisters were more particular than ever about their
attire, but at last they were dressed, and as soon as their carriage
had driven away, the Godmother appeared. Once more she touched her
godchild with her wand, and in a moment she was arrayed in a beautiful
dress that seemed as though it had been woven of moon-beams and
sunshine, so radiantly did it gleam and shimmer. She put her arms
round her Godmother's neck and kissed and thanked her. "Goodbye,
childie; enjoy yourself, but whatever you do, remember to leave
the ball before the clock strikes twelve," the Godmother said, and
Cinderella promised.

But the hours flew by so happily and so swiftly that Cinderella forgot
her promise, until she happened to look at a clock and saw that it was
on the stroke of twelve. With a cry of alarm she fled from the room,
dropping, in her haste, one of the little glass slippers; but, with
the sound of the clock strokes in her ears, she dared not wait to pick
it up. The Prince hurried after her in alarm, but when he reached the
entrance hall, the beautiful Princess had vanished, and there was no
one to be seen but a forlorn little beggar-maid creeping away into the
darkness.

Poor little Cinderella!--she hurried home through the dark streets,
weary, and overwhelmed with shame.

The fire was out when she reached her home, and there was no Godmother
waiting to receive her; but she sat down in the chimney-corner to wait
her sisters' return. When they came in they could speak of nothing but
the wonderful things that had happened at the ball.

The beautiful Princess had been there again, they said, but had
disappeared just as the clock struck twelve, and though the Prince had
searched everywhere for her, he had been unable to find her. "He was
quite beside himself with grief," said the elder sister, "for there is
no doubt he hoped to make her his bride."

Cinderella listened in silence to all they had to say, and, slipping
her hand into her pocket, felt that the one remaining glass slipper
was safe, for it was the only thing of all her grand apparel that
remained to her.

On the following morning there was a great noise of trumpets and
drums, and a procession passed through the town, at the head of
which rode the King's son. Behind him came a herald, bearing a velvet
cushion, upon which rested a little glass slipper. The herald blew a
blast upon the trumpet, and then read a proclamation saying that the
King's son would wed any lady in the land who could fit the slipper
upon her foot, if she could produce another to match it.

Of course, the sisters tried to squeeze their feet into the slipper,
but it was of no use--they were much too large. Then Cinderella shyly
begged that she might try. How the sisters laughed with scorn when the
Prince knelt to fit the slipper on the cinder-maid's foot; but what
was their surprise when it slipped on with the greatest ease, and the
next moment Cinderella produced the other from her pocket. Once more
she stood in the slippers, and once more the sisters saw before them
the lovely Princess who was to be the Prince's bride. For at the touch
of the magic shoes, the little gray frock disappeared for ever, and in
place of it she wore the beautiful robe the fairy Godmother had given
to her.

The sisters hung their heads with sorrow and vexation; but kind little
Cinderella put her arms round their necks, kissed them, and forgave
them for all their unkindness, so that they could not help but love
her.

The Prince could not bear to part from his little love again, so
he carried her back to the palace in his grand coach, and they were
married that very day. Cinderella's stepsisters were present at the
feast, but in the place of honor sat the fairy Godmother.

So the poor little cinder-maid married the Prince, and in time they
came to be King and Queen, and lived happily ever after.

THE THREE BROTHERS


There was once a man who had three sons, but no fortune except the
house he lived in. Now, each of them wanted to have the house after
his death; but their father was just as fond of one as of the other,
and did not know how to treat them all fairly. He did not want to sell
the house, because it had belonged to his forefathers, or he might
have divided the money between them.

At last an idea came into his head, and he said to his sons: "Go out
into the world, and each learn a trade, and when you come home, the
one who makes best use of his handicraft shall have the house."

The sons were quite content with this plan, and the eldest decided
to be a farrier, the second a barber, and the third a fencing master.
They fixed a time when they would all meet at home again, and then
they set off.

It so happened that they each found a clever master with whom they
learned their business thoroughly. The farrier shod the King's horses,
and he thought, "I shall certainly be the one to have the house."

The barber shaved nobody but grand gentlemen, so he thought it would
fall to him.

The fencing master got many blows, but he set his teeth, and would not
let himself be put out, because he thought, "If I am afraid of a blow,
I shall never get the house."

Now, when the given time had passed, they all went home together to
their father; but they did not know how to get a good opportunity of
showing off their powers, and sat down to discuss the matter.

Suddenly a hare came running over the field.

"Ah!" cried the barber, "she comes just in the nick of time."

He took up his bowl and his soap, and got his lather by the time the
hare came quite close, then he soaped her and shaved her as she raced
along, without giving her a cut or missing a single hair. His father,
astonished, said: "If the others don't look out, the house will be
yours."

Before long a gentleman came along in his carriage at full gallop.

"Now, father, you shall see what I can do," said the farrier and he
ran after the carriage and tore the four shoes off the horse as he
galloped along, then, without stopping a second, shod him with new
ones.

"You are a fine fellow, indeed," said his father. "You know your
business as well as your brother. I don't know which I shall give the
house to at this rate."

Then the third one said: "Let me have a chance, too, father."

As it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword and swirled it round
and round his head, so that not a drop fell on him. Even when the rain
grew heavier, so heavy that it seemed as if it were being poured from
the sky out of buckets, he swung the sword faster and faster, and
remained as dry as if he had been under a roof.

His father was amazed, and said: "You have done the best; the house is
yours."

Both the other brothers were quite satisfied with this decision, and
as they were all so devoted to one another, they lived together in
the house, and carried on their trades, by which they made plenty of
money, since they were so perfect in them.

They lived happily together to a good old age, and when one fell ill
and died, the others grieved so much over him that they pined away and
soon after departed this life.

Then, as they had been so fond of one another, they were all buried in
one grave.

THE WREN AND THE BEAR


One summer's day the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and
the bear heard a bird singing very sweetly, and said: "Brother Wolf,
what kind of bird is that which is singing so delightfully?"

"That is the King of the birds, before whom we must do reverence,"
replied the wolf; but it was only the wren.

"If that be so," said the bear, "I should like to see his royal
palace; come, lead me to it." "That cannot be as you like," replied
the wolf. "You must wait till the Queen returns." Soon afterward the
Queen arrived with some food in her bill, and the King, too, to feed
their young ones, and the bear would have gone off to see them, but
the wolf, pulling his ear, said: "No, you must wait till the Queen and
the King are both off again."

So, after observing well the situation of the nest, the two tramped
off, but the bear had no rest, for he wished still to see the royal
palace, and after a short delay he set off to it again. He found the
King and Queen absent, and, peeping into the nest, he saw five or six
young birds lying in it. "Is this the royal palace?" exclaimed the
bear; "this miserable place! You are no King's children, but wretched
young vagabonds." "No, no, that we are not!" burst out the little
wrens together in a great passion, for to them this speech was
addressed. "No, no, we are born of honorable parents, and you, Mr.
Bear, shall make your words good!" At this speech the bear and the
wolf were much frightened, and ran back to their holes; but the little
wrens kept up an unceasing, clamor till their parents' return. As soon
as they came back with food in their mouths the little birds began,
"We will none of us touch a fly's leg, but will starve rather, until
you decide whether we are fine and handsome children or not, for the
bear has been here and insulted us!"

"Be quiet," replied the King, "and that shall soon be settled." And
thereupon he flew with his Queen to the residence of the bear, and
called to him from the entrance, "Old grumbler, why have you insulted
my children? That shall cost you dear, for we will decide the matter
by a pitched battle."

War having thus been declared against the bear, all the four-footed
beasts were summoned: the ox, the ass, the cow, the goat, the stag,
and every animal on the face of the earth. The wren, on the other
hand, summoned every flying thing; not only the birds, great and
small, but also the gnat, the hornet, the bee, and the flies.

When the time arrived for the commencement of the war, the wren King
sent out spies to see who was appointed commander-in-chief of
the enemy. The gnat was the most cunning of all the army, and he,
therefore, buzzed away into the forest where the enemy was encamped,
and alighted on a leaf of the tree beneath which the watchword was
given out. There stood the bear and called the fox to him, and said:
"You are the most crafty of animals, so you must be general, and lead
us on." "Well," said the fox, "but what sign shall we appoint?" Nobody
answered. Then the fox said: "I have a fine long bushy tail, which
looks like a red feather at a distance; if I hold this tail straight
up, all is going well and you must march after me; but if I suffer it
to hang down, run away as fast as you can." As soon as the gnat heard
all this she flew home and told the wren King everything to a hair.

When the day arrived for the battle to begin, the four-footed beasts
all came running along to the field, shaking the earth with their
roaring and bellowing. The wren King also came with his army, whirring
and buzzing and humming enough to terrify any one out of his senses.
Then the wren King sent the hornet forward to settle upon the fox's
tail and sting it with all his power. As soon as the fox felt the
first sting he drew up his hind leg with the pain, still carrying,
however, his tail as high in the air as before; at the second sting
he was obliged to drop it a little bit; but at the third he could
no longer bear the pain, but was forced to drop his tail between his
legs. As soon as the other beasts saw this, they thought all was lost,
and began to run each one to his own hole; so the birds won the battle
without difficulty.

When all was over the wren King and his Queen flew home to their
children, and cried out: "Rejoice! rejoice! we have won the battle;
now eat and drink as much as you please."

The young wrens, however, said: "Still we will not eat till the bear
has come to our nest and begged pardon, and admitted that we are fine
and handsome children."

So the wren King flew back to the cave of the bear, and called out,
"Old grumbler, you must come to the nest and beg pardon of my children
for calling them wretched young brats, else your ribs shall be crushed
in your body!"

In great terror the bear crept out and begged pardon; and afterward
the young wrens, being now made happy in their minds, settled down to
eating and drinking, and I am afraid they were over-excited and kept
up their merriment far too late.

CHICKEN-LICKEN


As Chicken-licken was going one day to the wood, whack! an acorn fell
from a tree on to his head.

"Gracious goodness me!" said Chicken-licken, "the sky must have
fallen; I must go and tell the King."

So Chicken-licken turned back, and met Hen-len.

"Well, Hen-len, where are you going?" said he.

"I'm going to the wood," said she.

"Oh, Hen-len, don't go!" said he, "for as I was going the sky fell on
to my head, and I'm going to tell the King."

So Hen-len turned back with Chicken-licken, and met Cock-lock.

"I'm going to the wood," said he.

Then Hen-len said: "Oh Cock-lock, don't go, for I was going, and I met
Chicken-licken, and Chicken-licken had been at the wood, and the sky
had fallen on to his head, and we are going to tell the King."

So Cock-lock turned back, and they met Duck-luck.

"Well, Duck-luck, where are you going?"

And Duck-luck said: "I'm going to the wood."

Then Cock-lock said: "Oh! Duck-luck, don't go, for I was going, and
I met Hen-len, and Hen-len met Chicken-licken, and Chicken-licken had
been at the wood, and the sky had fallen on to his head, and we are
going to tell the King."

So Duck-luck turned back, and met Drake-lake.

"Well, Drake-lake, where are you going?"

And Drake-lake said: "I'm going to the wood."

Then Duck-luck said: "Oh! Drake-lake, don't go, for I was going, and
I met Cock-lock, and Cock-lock met Hen-len, and Hen-len met
Chicken-licken, and Chicken-licken had been at the wood, and the sky
had fallen on to his head, and we are going to tell the King."

So Drake-lake turned back, and met Goose-loose.

"Well, Goose-loose, where are you going?"

And Goose-loose said: "I'm going to the wood."

Then Drake-lake said: "Oh, Goose-loose, don't go, for I was going,
and I met Duck-luck, and Duck-luck met Cock-lock, and Cock-lock met
Hen-len, and Hen-len met Chicken-licken, and Chicken-licken had been
at the wood, and the sky had fallen on to his head, and we are going
to tell the King."

So Goose-loose turned back, and met Gander-lander.

"Well, Gander-lander, where are you going?"

And Gander-lander said: "I'm going to the wood."

Then Goose-loose said: "Oh! Gander-lander, don't go, for I was going,
and I met Drake-lake, and Drake-lake met Duck-luck, and Duck-luck met
Cock-lock, and Cock-lock met Hen-len, and Hen-len met Chicken-licken,
and Chicken-licken had been at the wood, and the sky had fallen on to
his head, and we are going to tell the King."

So Gander-lander turned back, and met Turkey-lurkey.

"Well, Turkey-lurkey, where are you going?"

And Turkey-lurkey said: "I'm going to the wood."

Then Gander-lander said: "Oh! Turkey-lurkey, don't go, for I was
going, and I met Goose-loose, and Goose-loose met Drake-lake, and
Drake-lake met Duck-luck, and Duck-luck met Cock-lock, and Cock-lock
met Hen-len, and Hen-len met Chicken-licken, and Chicken-licken had
been at the wood, and the sky had fallen on to his head, and we are
going to tell the King."

So Turkey-lurkey turned back, and walked with Gander-lander,
Goose-loose, Drake-lake, Duck-luck, Cock-lock, Hen-len, and
Chicken-licken.

And as they were going along, they met Fox-lox. And Fox-lox said:

"Where are you going?"

And they said: "Chicken-licken went to the wood, and the sky fell on
to his head, and we are going to tell the King."

And Fox-lox said: "Come along with me, and I will show you the way."

But Fox-lox took them into the fox's hole, and he and his young
ones soon ate up poor Chicken-licken, Hen-len, Cock-lock, Duck-luck,
Drake-lake, Goose-loose, Gander-lander, and Turkey-lurkey; and they
never saw the King to tell him that the sky had fallen.

THE FOX AND THE CAT


It happened once that the cat met Mr. Fox in the wood, and because she
thought he was clever and experienced in all the ways of the world,
she addressed him in a friendly manner.

"Good-morning, dear Mr. Fox! how are you, and how do you get along in
these hard times?"

The fox, full of pride, looked at the cat from head to foot for some
time, hardly knowing whether he would deign to answer or not. At last
he said:

"Oh, you poor whisker-wiper, you silly piebald, you starveling
mouse-hunter! what has come into your head? How dare you ask me how I
am getting on? What sort of education have you had? How many arts are
you master of?"

"Only one," said the cat meekly.

"And what might that one be?" asked the fox.

"When the dogs run after me, I can jump into a tree and save myself."

"Is that all?" said the fox. "I am master of a hundred arts, and I
have a sackful of cunning tricks in addition. But I pity you. Come
with me, and I will teach you how to escape from the dogs."

Just then a huntsman came along with four hounds. The cat sprang
trembling into a tree, and crept stealthily up to the topmost branch,
where she was entirely hidden by twigs and leaves.

"Open your sack, Mr. Fox! open your sack!" cried the cat, but the dogs
had gripped him, and held him fast.

"Oh, Mr. Fox!" cried the cat, "you with your hundred arts, and your
sackful of tricks, are held fast, while I, with my one, am safe. Had
you been able to creep up here, you would not have lost you life."

THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW


There once lived in Japan a rat and his wife, folk of noble race, who
had one beautiful daughter. They were exceedingly proud of her charms,
and dreamed, as parents will, of the grand marriage she was sure
to make in time. Proud of his pure rodent blood, the father saw no
son-in-law more to be desired than a young rat of ancient lineage,
whose attentions to his daughter were very marked. This match,
however, brilliant as it was, seemed not to the mother's taste. Like
many people who think themselves made out of special clay, she had a
very poor opinion of her own kind, and was ambitious for an alliance
with the highest circles. To the stars! was her motto, she always
said, and really, when one has a daughter of incomparable beauty, one
may well hope for an equally incomparable son-in-law.

"Address yourself to the sun at once, then," cried the impatient
father one day; "there is nothing above him, surely."

"Quite so; I had already thought of it," she answered, "and since you,
too, are in sympathy with the idea, we will make our call to-morrow."

So, on the following morning the proud father and the haughty
mother-rat went together to present their lovely daughter to the orb
of day.

"Lord Sun," said the mother, "let me present our only daughter, who
is so beautiful that there is nothing like her in the whole world.
Naturally we desire a son-in-law as wonderful as she, and, as you see,
we have come to you first of all."

"Really," said the sun, "I am extremely flattered by your proposal,
but you do me too much honor; there is some one greater than I; it is
the cloud. Look, if you do not believe."... And at that moment the
cloud arrived, and with one waft of his folds extinguished the sun
with all his golden rays.

"Very well; let us speak to the cloud, then," said the mother-rat, not
in the least disconcerted.

"Immensely honored, I am sure," replied the cloud in his turn, "but
you are again mistaken; there is some one greater than I; it is the
wind. You shall see."

At the same moment along came the wind, and with one blow swept the
cloud out of sight, after which, overturning father, mother, and
daughter, he tumbled with them, pell-mell, at the foot of an old wall.

"Quick, quick," cried the mother-rat, struggling to her feet, "and let
us repeat our compliments to the wind."

"You'd better address yourself to the wall," growled the wind roughly.
"You see very well he is greater than I, for he stops me and makes me
draw back."

No sooner had she heard these words than mother-rat faced about and
presented her daughter to the wall. Ah, but now the fair rat-maiden
imitated the wind; she drew back also. He whom she really adored in
her heart of hearts was the fascinating young rat who had paid his
court to her so well. However, to please her mother, she had consented
to wed the Sun, in spite of his blinding rays, or the cloud, in spite
of his sulky look, even the wind, in spite of his brusque manner; but
an old, broken wall!... No! death would be better a thousand times.

Fortunately the wall excused himself, like all the rest. "Certainly,"
he said, "I can stop the wind, who can sweep away the cloud, who can
cover up the Sun, but there is some one greater than I: it is the rat,
who can pass through my body, and can even, if he chooses, reduce
me to powder with his teeth. Believe me, you need seek no better
son-in-law; greater than the rat, there is nothing in the world."

"Do you hear that, wife, do you hear it?" cried father-rat in triumph.
"Didn't I always say so?"

"Quite true! you always did," returned the mother-rat in wonder, and
suddenly glowed with pride in her ancient name and lineage.

So they all three went home, very happy and contented, and on the
morrow the lovely rat-maiden married her faithful rat-lover.

THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE


Once upon a time a little mouse and a little sausage, who loved
each other like sisters, decided to live together, and made their
arrangements in such a way that every day one would go to walk in the
fields, or make purchases in town, while the other remained at home to
keep the house.

One day, when the little sausage had prepared cabbage for dinner,
the little mouse, who had come back from town with a fine appetite,
enjoyed it so greatly that she exclaimed: "How delicious the cabbage
is to-day, my dear!"

"Ah!" answered the little sausage, "that is because I popped myself
into the pot while it was cooking."

On the next day, as it was her turn to prepare the meals, the little
mouse said to herself: "Now I will do as much for my friend as she did
for me; we will have lentils for dinner, and I will jump into the
pot while they are boiling," and she let the action follow the word,
without reflecting that a simple sausage can do some things which are
out of the reach of even the wisest mouse.

When the sausage came home, she found the house lonely and silent. She
called again and again, "My little mouse! Mouse of my heart!" but no
one answered. Then she went to look at the lentils boiling on the
stove, and, alas! found within the pot her good little friend, who had
perished at the post of duty.

Poor mousie, with the best intentions in the world, had stayed too
long at her cookery, and when she desired to climb out of the pot, had
no longer the strength to do so.

And the poor sausage could never be consoled! That is why to-day, when
you put one in the pan or on the gridiron, you will hear her weep and
sigh, "M-my p-poor m-mouse! Ah, m-my p-poor m-mouse!"

JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE


There was once a man who had three sons. Johnny, the youngest, was
always looked upon as the simpleton of the family, and had very little
consideration or kindness shown him.

It happened one day that the eldest son was going out into the wood to
cut fuel; and before he started, his mother gave him a slice of rich
plum-cake and a flask of wine, so that he might not suffer from hunger
or thirst.

Just as he reached the wood, he met a queer old man, dressed in gray,
who wished him "Good day," and begged for a piece of the young man's
cake and a drink of wine.

But the greedy youth replied: "If I were to give you cake and wine, I
should not have enough left for myself; so be off with you, and leave
me in peace."

Then he pushed the little man rudely on one side and went his way. He
soon came to a likely-looking tree, and began to hew it down, but he
made a false stroke, and instead of striking the tree he buried his
axe in his own arm, and was obliged to hurry home as fast as he could
to have the wound dressed.

And this was what came of offending the little gray man!

The following day the second son set out to the wood, and his mother
treated him just as she had done her eldest son--gave him a slice of
cake and a flask of wine, in case he should feel hungry. The little
gray man met him at the entrance to the wood, and begged for a share
of his food, but the young man answered:

"The more I give to you, the less I have for myself. Be off with you."

Then he left the little gray man standing in the road, and went on his
way. But it was not long before he, too, was punished; for the first
stroke he aimed at a tree glanced aside and wounded his leg, so that
he was obliged to be carried home.

Then said the Simpleton: "Father, let me go to the wood for once. _I_
will bring you home plenty of fuel."

"Nonsense," answered the father. "Both your brothers have got into
trouble, and it is not likely that I am going to trust you."

But Johnny would not give up the idea, and worried his father, till at
last he said:

"Very well, my son, have your own way. You shall learn by experience
that I know better than you."

There was no rich cake for the simpleton of the family. His mother
just gave him a little loaf of dough and a bottle of sour beer.

No sooner did he reach the wood than the little gray man appeared.

"Give me a piece of your cake and a drink of your wine?" said he.

But the young man told him he had only a dough loaf and a bottle of
sour beer.

"Still," said he, "you are welcome to a share of the food, such as it
is."

So the two sat down together; but when Johnny took his humble fare
from his pocket, what was his surprise to find it changed into the
most delicious cake and wine. Then the young man and his guest made a
hearty meal, and when it was ended the little gray man said:

"Because you have such a kind heart, and have willingly shared your
food with me, I am going to reward you. Yonder stands an old tree: hew
it down, and deep in the heart of the roots you will find something."

The old man then nodded kindly, and disappeared in a moment.

Johnny at once did as he had been told, and as soon as the tree fell
he saw, sitting in the midst of the roots, a goose with feathers of
purest gold. He lifted it carefully out, and carried it with him to
the inn, where he meant to spend the night.

Now, the landlord had three daughters, and no sooner did they see the
goose than they wanted to know what curious kind of bird it might be,
for never before had they seen a fowl of any kind with feathers of
pure gold. The eldest made up her mind to wait for a good opportunity
and then pluck a feather for herself. So as soon as Johnny went out
of the room she put out her hand and seized the wing of the goose,
but what was her horror to find that she could not unclasp her fingers
again, nor even move her hand from the golden goose!

Very soon the second sister came creeping into the room, meaning also
to steal a feather; but no sooner did she touch her sister than she,
too, was unable to draw her hand away.

Lastly came the third, anxious to secure a feather before the goose's
master returned.

"Go away! go away!" screamed her two sisters, but she could not
understand why she should not help herself as well as the others.

So she paid no heed to their cries, but came toward them and stretched
out her hand to the goose.

In doing so she touched her second sister, and then, alas! she too,
was held fast.

They pulled and tugged with might and main, but it was all of no use;
they could not get away, and there they had to remain the whole night.

The next morning Johnny tucked the goose under his arm, and went on
his way, never troubling himself about the three girls hanging on
behind.

Then what a dance he led them: over hedges and ditches, highways and
byways! Wherever he led they were bound to follow. Half way across a
sunny meadow, they met the parson, who was terribly shocked to see the
three girls running after a young man.

"For shame!" he cried angrily, and seized the youngest by the hand to
drag her away.

But no sooner did he touch her than the poor parson was made fast too,
and had to run behind the girls, whether he would or no.

They had scarcely gone half a dozen paces before they met the sexton,
who stared with astonishment to see his master running at the heels of
the three girls.

"Hi! stop, your reverence," he cried. "You will be late for the
christening."

He seized the parson's sleeve as he ran past him, but the poor sexton
had to join the procession too.

So now there were five of them, and just as they turned a corner the
parson saw two peasants, and called to them to set him and his sexton
free.

They threw down their spades at once and tried to do so, but they too,
stuck fast, and so Johnny had a fine string of seven folk hanging on
to the wing of his golden goose.

On and on they ran, until at length they came into the country of a
powerful King.

This King had an only daughter, who all her life had been so sad that
no one had ever been able to make her laugh. So the King made a decree
that the man who could bring a smile to his daughter's face should
have her for his bride.

When Johnny heard what the King had promised, he at once made his way
into the Princess's presence, and when she saw the goose, with the
seven queer-looking companions hanging on behind, she burst into such
a hearty fit of laughter that it was thought she would never be able
to stop again.

Of course, the Simpleton claimed her as his bride, but the King did
not fancy him for a son-in-law, so he made all sorts of excuses.

"You shall have her," said he, "if you can first bring me a man who can
drink up a whole cellarful of wine."

Johnny at once remembered the little gray man, and, feeling sure that
he would help him, he set out for the wood where he had first met him.

When he reached the stump of the old tree which he had himself hewn
down, he noticed a man sitting beside it, with a face as gloomy as a
rainy day.

Johnny asked politely what ailed him, and the man answered:

"I suffer from a thirst I cannot quench. Cold water disagrees with
me, and though I have, it is true, emptied a barrel of wine, it was no
more to me than a single drop of water upon a hot stone."

You can think how pleased Johnny was to hear these words. He took
the man to the King's cellar, where he seated himself before the huge
barrels, and drank and drank till, at the end of the day, not a drop
of wine was left.

Then Johnny claimed his bride, but the King could not make up his mind
to give his daughter to "a ne'er-do-weel" who went by such a name as
"Simpleton."

So he made fresh excuses, and said that he would not give her up until
the young man had found someone who could eat up a mountain of bread
in a single day.

So the young man had no choice but to set out once more for the wood.

And again he found a man sitting beside the stump of the tree. He was
very sad and hungry-looking, and sat tightening the belt round his
waist.

"I have eaten a whole ovenful of bread," he said sadly, "but when one
is as hungry as I am, such a meal only serves to make one more hungry
still. I am so empty that if I did not tighten my belt I should die of
hunger."

"You are the man for me!" said Johnny. "Follow me, and I will give you
a meal that will satisfy even your hunger."

He led the man into the courtyard of the King's palace, where all
the meal in the kingdom had been collected together and mixed into an
enormous mountain of bread.

The man from the wood placed himself in front of it and began to eat,
and before the day was over the mountain of bread had vanished.

A third time the Simpleton demanded his bride, but again the King
found an excuse.

"First bring me a ship that can sail both on land and sea, and then
you shall wed the Princess," he said.

Johnny went straightway to the wood, where he met the little gray man
with whom he had once shared his food.

"Good day," he said, nodding his wise little head. "So you've come to
visit me again, eh? It was I, you know, who drank the wine and ate the
bread for you, and now I will finish by giving you the wonderful ship
which is to sail on either land or sea. All this I do for you because
you were kind and good to me."

Then he gave him the ship, and when the King saw it he could find no
further excuse.

So he gave the young man his daughter, and the pair were married that
very day.

When the old King died, the Simpleton became King in his stead, and he
and his wife lived happily ever after.

TITTY MOUSE AND TATTY MOUSE


  Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse both lived in a house,
    Titty Mouse went a-leasing and Tatty Mouse went a-leasing,
    So they both went a-leasing.
  Titty Mouse leased an ear of corn, and Tatty Mouse leased an ear of corn,
    So they both leased an ear of corn.
  Titty Mouse made a pudding, and Tatty Mouse made a pudding,
    So they both made a pudding.
  And Tatty Mouse put her pudding into the pot to boil,
    But, when Titty went to put hers in, the pot tumbled over, and
    scalded her to death.

Then Tatty sat down and wept, and a three-legged stool said: "Tatty,
why do you weep?" "Titty's dead," said Tatty, "and so I weep." "Then,"
said the stool, "I'll hop." So the stool hopped.

Then a broom in the corner of the room said: "Stool, why do you hop?"
"Oh!" said the stool, "Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and so I hop."
"Then," said the broom, "I'll sweep." So the broom began to sweep.

"Then," said the door, "Broom, why do you sweep?" "Oh!" said the
broom, "Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and so I
sweep." "Then," said the door, "I'll jar." So the door jarred.

"Then," said the window, "Door, why do you jar?" "Oh!" said the door,
"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom
sweeps, and so I jar."

"Then," said the window, "I'll creak." So the window creaked. Now
there was an old form outside the house, and when the window creaked,
the form said: "Window, why do you creak?" "Oh!" said the window,
"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom
sweeps, the door jars, and so I creak."

"Then," said the old form, "I'll run round the house." Then the old
form ran round the house. Now there was a fine large walnut-tree
growing by the cottage, and the tree said to the form: "Form, why
do you run round the house?" "Oh!" said the form, "Titty's dead, and
Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars,
and the window creaks, and so I run round the house."

"Then," said the walnut-tree, "I'll shed my leaves." So the
walnut-tree shed all its beautiful green leaves. Now there was a
little bird perched on one of the boughs of the tree, and when all
the leaves fell, it said: "Walnut-tree, why do you shed your leaves?"
"Oh!" said the tree, "Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops,
and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old
form runs round the house, and so I shed my leaves."

"Then," said the little bird, "I'll moult all my feathers." So he
moulted all his pretty feathers. Now there was a little girl walking
below, carrying a jug of milk for her brothers' and sisters' supper,
and when she saw the poor little bird moult all its feathers, she
said: "Little bird, why do you moult all your feathers?" "Oh!" said
the little bird, "Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and
the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form
runs round the house, the walnut-tree sheds its leaves, and so I
moult all my feathers."

"Then," said the little girl, "I'll spill the milk." So she dropped
the pitcher and spilt the milk. Now there was an old man just by on
the top of a ladder thatching a rick, and when he saw the little girl
spill the milk, he said: "Little girl, what do you mean by spilling
the milk? Your little brothers and sisters must go without their
supper." Then said the little girl: "Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps,
the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window
creaks, the old form runs round the house, the walnut-tree sheds all
its leaves, the little bird moults all its feathers, and so I spill
the milk."

"Oh!" said the old man, "then I'll tumble off the ladder and break my
neck." So he tumbled off the ladder and broke his neck; and when the
old man broke his neck, the great walnut-tree fell down with a crash,
and upset the old form and house, and the house falling knocked the
window out, and the window knocked the door down, and the door upset
the broom, and the broom upset the stool, and poor little Tatty Mouse
was buried beneath the ruins.

TEENY TINY


There was once upon a time a teeny-tiny woman who lived in a
teeny-tiny house in a teeny-tiny village. Now, one day this teeny-tiny
woman put on her teeny-tiny bonnet, and went out of her teeny-tiny
house to take a teeny-tiny walk. And when this teeny-tiny woman
had gone a teeny-tiny way, she came to a teeny-tiny gate; so
the teeny-tiny woman opened the teeny-tiny gate, and went into a
teeny-tiny churchyard. And when this teeny-tiny woman had got into
the teeny-tiny churchyard, she saw a teeny-tiny bone on a teeny-tiny
grave, and the teeny-tiny woman said to her teeny-tiny self: "This
teeny-tiny bone will make me some teeny-tiny soup for my teeny-tiny
supper." So the teeny-tiny woman put the teeny-tiny bone into her
teeny-tiny pocket, and went home to her teeny-tiny house.

Now, when the teeny-tiny woman got home to her teeny-tiny house, she
was a teeny-tiny tired; so she went up her teeny-tiny stairs to
her teeny-tiny bed, and put the teeny-tiny bone into a teeny-tiny
cupboard. And when this teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep a
teeny-tiny time, she was awakened by a teeny-tiny voice from the
teeny-tiny cupboard, which said--

"GIVE ME MY BONE!"

And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny frightened, so she hid her
teeny-tiny head under the teeny-tiny clothes, and went to sleep again.
And when she had been asleep again a teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny
voice cried out from the teeny-tiny cupboard a teeny-tiny louder--

"GIVE ME MY BONE!"

This made the teeny-tiny woman a teeny-tiny more frightened, so she
hid her teeny-tiny head a teeny-tiny farther under the teeny-tiny
clothes. And when the teeny-tiny woman had been asleep again a
teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard
said again a teeny-tiny louder--

"GIVE ME MY BONE!"

At this the teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny bit more frightened; but
she put her teeny-tiny head out of the teeny-tiny clothes, and said in
her loudest teeny-tiny voice--

"TAKE IT!!"

THE SPIDER AND THE FLEA


A Spider and a Flea dwelt together in one house, and brewed their beer
in an egg-shell. One day, when the Spider was stirring it up, she fell
in and scalded herself. Thereupon the Flea began to scream. And then
the door asked: "Why are you screaming, Flea?"

"Because little Spider has scalded herself in the beer-tub," replied
she.

Thereupon the door began to creak as if it were in pain; and a broom,
which stood in the corner, asked, "What are you creaking for, door?"

"May I not creak?" it replied:

          "The little Spider's scalt herself,
              And the Flea weeps."

So the broom began to sweep industriously, and presently a little cart
came by, and asked the reason. "May I not sweep?" replied the broom:

          "The little Spider's scalt herself,
              And the Flea weeps;
          The little door creaks with the pain,"--

Thereupon the little cart said: "So will I run," and began to run very
fast, past a heap of ashes, which cried out: "Why do you run, little
cart?"

"Because," replied the cart:

          "The little Spider's scalt herself,
              And the Flea weeps;
          The little door creaks with the pain,
              And the broom sweeps."

"Then," said the ashes, "I will burn furiously." Now, next the ashes
there grew a tree, which asked: "Little heap, why do you burn?"

"Because," was the reply:

           "The little Spider's scalt herself,
              And the Flea weeps;
           The little door creaks with the pain,
              And the broom sweeps;
           The little cart runs on so fast,"--

Thereupon the tree cried, "I will shake myself!" and went on shaking
till all its leaves fell off.

A little girl passing by with a water-pitcher saw it shaking, and
asked: "Why do you shake yourself, little tree?"

"Why may I not?" said the tree:

          "The little Spider's scalt herself,
              And the Flea weeps;
          The little door creaks with the pain,
              And the broom sweeps;
          The little cart runs on so fast,
              And the ashes burn."

Then the maiden said: "If so, I will break my pitcher;" and she threw
it down and broke it.

At this the streamlet, from which she drew the water, asked:

"Why do you break your pitcher, my little girl?"

"Why may I not?" she replied; for

         "The little Spider's scalt herself,
              And the Flea weeps;
          The little door creaks with the pain,
              And the broom sweeps;
          The little cart runs on so fast,
              And the ashes burn;
          The little tree shakes down its leaves--
              Now it is my turn!"

"Ah, then," said the streamlet, "now must I begin to flow." And it
flowed and flowed along, in a great stream, which kept getting bigger
and bigger, until at last it swallowed up the little girl, the little
tree, the ashes, the cart, the broom, the door, the Flea, and, last of
all, the Spider, all together.

THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY


Once upon a time there was a little shepherd boy who was famed far and
wide for the wise answers which he gave to all questions. Now the King
of the country heard of this lad, but he would not believe what was
said about him, so the boy was ordered to come to court. When he
arrived the King said to him: "If you can give me answers to each of
the three questions which I will now put to you, I will bring you up
as my own child, and you shall live here with me in my palace."

"What are these three questions?" asked the boy.

"The first is: How many drops of water are there in the sea?"

"My lord King," replied the shepherd boy, "let all the waters be
stopped up on the earth, so that not one drop shall run into the sea
before I count it, and then I will tell you how many drops there are
in the sea!"

"The second question," said the King, "is: How many stars are there in
the sky?"

"Give me a large sheet of paper," said the boy; and then he made in it
with a pin so many minute holes that they were far too numerous to see
or to count, and dazzled the eyes of whomsoever looked at them. This
done, he said: "So many stars are there in the sky as there are holes
in this paper; now count them." But nobody was able. Thereupon the King
said: "The third question is: How many seconds are there in eternity?"

"In Lower Pomerania is situated the adamantine mountain, one mile in
height, one mile in breadth, and one mile deep; and thither comes
a bird once in every thousand years which rubs its beak against the
hill, and, when the whole shall be rubbed away, then will the first
second of eternity be gone by."

"You have answered the three questions like a sage," said the King,
"and from henceforward you shall live with me in my palace, and I will
treat you as my own child."

THE THREE SPINNERS


Once upon a time there was a lazy maiden who would not spin, and, let
her mother say what she would, she could not make her do it. At last,
the mother, in a fit of impatience, gave her a blow which made the
girl cry out loudly.

At that very instant, the Queen drove by, and, hearing the screams,
she stopped the carriage, came into the house, and asked the mother
why she beat her daughter in such a way that people in passing could
hear the cries.

Then the mother felt ashamed that her daughter's laziness should be
known, so she said: "Oh, your Majesty, I cannot take her away from her
spinning: she spins from morning till night, and I am so poor that I
cannot afford to buy the flax."

"There is nothing I like better than to hear the sound of spinning,"
the Queen replied, "and nothing pleases me more than the whirl of
spinning-wheels. Let me take your daughter home with me to the castle;
I have flax enough, and she may spin there to her heart's content."

The mother rejoiced greatly in her heart, and the Queen took the
maiden home with her. When they arrived in the castle, she led her up
into three rooms, which were piled from top to bottom with the finest
flax.

"Now spin me this flax," said the Queen, "and when thou has spun it
all, thou shalt have my eldest son for a husband. Although thou art
poor, yet I do not despise thee on that account, for thy untiring
industry is dowry enough."

The maiden was filled with inward terror, for she could not have spun
the flax had she sat there day and night until she was three hundred
years old! When she was left alone, she began to weep, and thus she
sat for three days without stirring a finger.

On the third day the Queen came, and when she saw that nothing was
as yet spun, she wondered over it, but the maiden excused herself by
saying that she could not begin in consequence of the great sorrow she
felt in being separated from her mother.

This satisfied the Queen, who, on leaving her, said:

"Thou must begin to work for me to-morrow."

But when the maiden was once more alone, she did not know what to do,
or how to help herself, and in her distress she went to the window and
looked out. She saw three women passing by, the first of whom had a
great broad foot, the second such a large under-lip that it hung down
to her chin, and the third an enormous thumb.

They stopped under the window, and, looking up, asked the maiden what
was the matter.

When she had told them of her trouble, they immediately offered her
their help, and said:

"Wilt thou invite us to the wedding, and not be ashamed of us, but
call us thy aunts, and let us sit at thy table? If thou wilt, we will
spin all the flax, and do it in a very short time."

"With all my heart," answered the girl, "only come in, and begin at
once."

Then she admitted the three strange women, and, making a clear space
in the first room, they sat themselves down and began spinning.

One drew the thread and trod the wheel, the other moistened the
thread, the third pressed it and beat it on the table, and every time
she did so, a pile of thread fell on the ground spun in the finest
way.

The maiden concealed the three spinners from the Queen, but showed
her the heaps of spun yarn whenever she came, and received no end of
praise for it.

When the first room was empty, the second was commenced, and when that
was finished, the third was begun, and very soon cleared.

Then the three spinners took their leave, saying to the maiden:

"Forget not what thou hast promised us; it will make thy fortune."

When the girl showed the Queen the empty rooms and the great piles of
thread, the wedding was announced. The bridegroom rejoiced that he had
won so clever and industrious a wife, and he praised her exceedingly.

"I have three aunts," said the maiden, "and as they have done me many
kindnesses, I could not forget them in my good fortune; permit me to
invite them to our wedding and allow them to sit with me at table."

So the Queen and the bridegroom consented.

When the feast commenced, the three old women entered, clothed in the
greatest splendor, and the bride said--

"Welcome, my dear aunts!"

"Alas!" exclaimed the bridegroom, "how is it you have such ugly
relations?" and going up to the one with a broad foot, he asked:

"Why have you such a broad foot?"

"From threading, from threading," she answered.

Then he went to the second, and asked:

"Why have you such an overhanging lip?"

"From moistening the thread," she replied, "from moistening the
thread."

Then he asked the third:

"Why have you such a big thumb?"

"From pressing the thread," answered she.

Then the Prince became frightened, and said:

"Then shall my lovely bride never more turn a spinning-wheel, as long
as she lives!"

Thus was the maiden freed from the hated flax-spinning.

THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP


A cat having made the acquaintance of a mouse, told her so much of the
great love and affection that he had for her, that the mouse at
last consented to live in the same house with him, and to have their
domestic affairs in common. "But we must provide for the winter,"
said the cat, "or we shall be starved; you, little mouse, cannot go
everywhere looking for food, or you will meet with an accident."

This advice was followed, and a pot was brought with some grease in
it. However, when they had got it, they could not imagine where it
should be put; but at last, after a long consideration, the cat said:
"I know no better place to put it than in the church, for there no
one dares to steal anything; we will set it beneath the organ, and not
touch it till we really want it."

So the pot was put away in safety; but not long afterward the cat
began to wish for it again, so he spoke to the mouse and said: "I have
to tell you that I am asked by my aunt to stand godfather to a little
son, white with brown marks, whom she has just brought into the world,
and so I must go to the christening. Let me go out to-day, and do you
stop at home and keep house."

"Certainly," answered the mouse; "pray, go; and if you eat anything
nice, think of me; I would also willingly drink a little of the sweet
red christening-wine."

But, alas! it was all a story; for the cat had no aunt, and had not
been asked to stand godfather to any one. He went straight to the
church, crept up to the grease-pot, and licked it till he had eaten
off the top; then he took a walk on the roofs of the houses in the
town, thinking over his situation, and now and then stretching himself
in the sun and stroking his whiskers as often as he thought of his
meal. When it was evening he went home again, and the mouse said: "So
you have come at last; what a charming day you must have had!"

"Yes," answered the cat; "it went off very well!"

"What have you named the kitten?" asked the mouse.

"_Top-off_," said the cat very quickly.

"_Top-off!_" replied the mouse; "that is a curious and remarkable
name; is it common in your family?"

"What does that matter?" said the cat; "it is not worse than
Crumb-stealer, as your children are called."

Not long afterward the cat felt the same longing as before, and said
to the mouse: "You must oblige me by taking care of the house once
more by yourself; I am again asked to stand godfather, and, since
the youngster has a white ring round his neck, I cannot get off the
invitation." So the good little mouse consented, and the cat crept
away behind the wall to the church again, and ate half the contents
of the grease-pot. "Nothing tastes better than what one eats by one's
self," said he, quite contented with his day's work; and when he came
home the mouse asked how this child was named.

"_Half-out_," answered the cat.

"_Half-out!_ What do you mean? I never heard such a name before in
my life; I will wager anything it is not in the calendar," but the
cat replied nothing.

Pussy's mouth soon began to water again at the recollection of the
feasting. "All good things come in threes," said he to the mouse. "I
am again required to be godfather; this child is quite black, and has
little white claws, but not a single white hair on his body; such a
thing only happens once in two years, so pray excuse me this time."

"_Top-off! Half-out!_" answered the mouse; "those are such curious
names, they make me a bit suspicious."

"Ah!" replied the cat, "there you sit in your gray coat and long tail,
thinking nonsense. That comes of never going out."

The mouse busied herself during the cat's absence in putting the house
in order, but meanwhile greedy puss licked the grease-pot clean out.
"When it is all done one will rest in peace," thought he to himself,
and as soon as night came he went home fat and tired. The mouse,
however, again asked what name the third child had received. "It
will not please you any better," answered the cat, "for he is called
_All-out_."

"_All-out!_" exclaimed the mouse; "well, that is certainly the most
curious name by far. I have never yet seen it in print. _All-out!_
What can that mean?" and, shaking her head, she rolled herself up and
went to sleep.

After that nobody else asked the cat to stand godfather; but the
winter had arrived, and nothing more was to be picked up out of doors;
so the mouse bethought herself of their store of provision, and said,
"Come, friend cat, we will go to our grease-pot which we laid by; it
will taste well now."

"Yes, indeed," replied the cat; "it will taste as well as if you
stroked your tongue against the window."

So they set out on their journey, and when they arrived at the church
the pot stood in its old place--but it was empty! "Ah," said the
mouse, "I see what has happened; now I know you are indeed a faithful
friend. You have eaten the whole as you stood godfather; first
_Top-off_, then _Half-out_, then--"

"Will you be quiet?" cried the cat. "Not a word, or I'll eat you." But
the poor mouse had "_All-out"_ at her tongue's end, and had scarcely
uttered it when the cat made a spring, seized her in his mouth, and
swallowed her.

This happens every day in the world.

THE SWEET SOUP


Once on a time there was a poor but very good little girl, who lived
alone with her mother, and when my story begins, they had nothing in
the house to eat. So the child went out into the forest, and there she
met an old woman, who already knew her distress, and who presented her
with a pot which had the following power. If one said to it, "Boil,
little pot!" it would cook sweet soup; and when one said: "Stop,
little pot!" it would immediately cease to boil. The little girl took
the pot home to her mother, and now their poverty and distresses were
at an end, for they could have sweet broth as often as they pleased.

One day, however, the little girl went out, and in her absence the
mother said: "Boil, little pot!" So it began to cook, and she soon ate
all she wished; but when the poor woman wanted to have the pot stop,
she found she did not know the word. Away, therefore, the pot boiled,
and very quickly was over the edge; and as it boiled and boiled the
kitchen presently became full, then the house, and the next house, and
soon the whole street. It seemed likely to satisfy all the world, for,
though there was the greatest necessity to do so, nobody knew how to
stop it. At last, when only a very small cottage of all the village
was left unfilled with soup, the child returned and said at once:
"Stop, little pot!"

Immediately it ceased to boil; but whoever wishes to enter the village
now must eat his way through the soup!!!

THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN


All alone, in a quiet little village, lived a poor old woman. One day
she had a dish of beans which she wanted to cook for dinner, so she
made a fire on the hearth, and in order that it should burn up quickly
she lighted it with a handful of straw.

She hung the pot over the fire, and poured in the beans; but one fell
on to the floor without her noticing it, and rolled away beside a
piece of straw. Soon afterwards a live coal flew out of the fire and
joined their company. Then the straw began to speak.

"Dear friends," said he, "whence come you?"

"I was fortunate enough to spring out of the fire," answered the
coal. "Had I not exerted myself to get out when I did, I should most
certainly have been burnt to ashes."

"I have also just managed to save my skin," said the bean. "Had the
old woman succeeded in putting me into the pot, I should have been
stewed without mercy, just as my comrades are being served now."

"My fate might have been no better," the straw told them. "The old
woman burnt sixty of my brothers at once, but fortunately I was able
to slip through her fingers."

"What shall we do now?" said the coal.

"Well," answered the bean, "my opinion is that, as we have all been
so fortunate as to escape death, we should leave this place before
any new misfortune overtakes us. Let us all three become traveling
companions and set out upon a journey to some unknown country."

This suggestion pleased both the straw and the coal, so away they all
went at once. Before long they came to a brook, and as there was no
bridge across it they did not know how to get to the other side; but
the straw had a good idea: "I will lay myself over the water, and
you can walk across me as though I were a bridge," he said. So he
stretched himself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was
of a hasty disposition, at once tripped gaily on to the newly-built
bridge. Half way across she hesitated, and began to feel afraid of the
rushing water beneath her. She dared go no farther, but neither would
she return; but she stood there so long that the straw caught fire,
broke in two, and fell into the stream. Of course, the coal was bound
to follow. No sooner did she touch the water than--hiss, zish! out she
went, and never glowed again.

The bean, who was a careful fellow, had stayed on the bank, to watch
how the coal got across, before trusting himself to such a slender
bridge. But when he saw what very queer figures his friends cut, he
could not help laughing. He laughed and laughed till he could not
stop, and at length he split his side.

It would have gone badly with him then, had not a tailor happened to
pass by. He was a kind-hearted fellow, and at once took out his needle
and thread and began to repair the mischief.

The bean thanked him politely, for he knew that the tailor had saved
his life, but unfortunately he had used black thread, and from that
time till to-day every bean has a little black stitch in its side.

WHY THE BEAR HAS A STUMPY TAIL


One winter's day the bear met the fox, who came slinking along with a
string of fish he had stolen.

"Hi! stop a minute! Where did you get those from?" demanded the bear.

"Oh, my Lord Bruin, I've been out fishing and caught them," said the
fox.

So the bear had a mind to learn to fish, too, and bade the fox tell
him how he was to set about it.

"Oh, it is quite easy," answered the fox, "and soon learned. You've
only got to go upon the ice, and cut a hole and stick your tail down
through it, and hold it there as long as you can. You're not to mind
if it smarts a little; that's when the fish bite. The longer you hold
it there, the more fish you'll get; and then all at once out with it,
with a cross pull side ways and a strong pull, too."

Well, the bear did as the fox said, and though he felt very cold, and
his tail smarted very much, he kept it a long, long time down in the
hole, till at last it was frozen in, though of course he did not know
that. Then he pulled it out with a strong pull, and it snapped short
off, and that's why Bruin goes about with a stumpy tail to this day!

THE THREE LITTLE PIGS


Once upon a time, when pigs could talk and no one had ever heard of
bacon, there lived an old piggy mother with her three little sons.

They had a very pleasant home in the middle of an oak forest, and were
all just as happy as the day was long, until one sad year the acorn
crop failed; then, indeed, poor Mrs. Piggy-wiggy often had hard work
to make both ends meet.

One day she called her sons to her, and, with tears in her eyes, told
them that she must send them out into the wide world to seek their
fortune.

She kissed them all round, and the three little pigs set out upon
their travels, each taking a different road, and carrying a bundle
slung on a stick across his shoulder.

The first little pig had not gone far before he met a man carrying a
bundle of straw; so he said to him: "Please, man, give me that straw
to build me a house?" The man was very good-natured, so he gave him
the bundle of straw, and the little pig built a pretty little house
with it.

No sooner was it finished, and the little pig thinking of going to
bed, than a wolf came along, knocked at the door, and said: "Little
pig, little pig, let me come in."

But the little pig laughed softly, and answered: "No, no, by the hair
of my chinny-chin-chin."

Then said the wolf sternly: "I will _make_ you let me in; for I'll
huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!"

So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house in, because, you
see, it was only of straw and too light; and when he had blown the
house in, he ate up the little pig, and did not leave so much as the
tip of his tail.

The second little pig also met a man, and _he_ was carrying a bundle
of furze; so piggy said politely: "Please, kind man, will you give me
that furze to build me a house?"

The man agreed, and piggy set to work to build himself a snug little
house before the night came on. It was scarcely finished when the wolf
came along, and said: "Little pig, little pig, let me come in."

"No, no, by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin," answered the second
little pig.

"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!" said the
wolf. So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and at
last he blew the house in, and gobbled the little pig up in a trice.

Now, the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks and mortar,
and he said: "Please, man, will you give me those bricks to build a
house with?"

So the man gave him the bricks and mortar, and a little trowel as
well, and the little pig built himself a nice strong little house. As
soon as it was finished the wolf came to call, just as he had done to
the other little pigs, and said: "Little pig, little pig, let me in!"

But the little pig answered: "No, no, by the hair of my
chinny-chin-chin."

"Then," said the wolf, "I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your
house in."

Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he
huffed, and he puffed; but he could _not_ get the house down. At last
he had no breath left to huff and puff with, so he sat down outside
the little pig's house and thought for awhile.

Presently he called out: "Little pig, I know where there is a nice
field of turnips."

"Where?" said the little pig.

"Behind the farmer's house, three fields away, and if you will be
ready to-morrow morning I will call for you, and we will go together
and get some breakfast."

"Very well," said the little pig; "I will be sure to be ready. What
time do you mean to start?"

"At six o'clock," replied the wolf.

Well, the wise little pig got up at five, scampered away to the field,
and brought home a fine load of turnips before the wolf came. At six
o'clock the wolf came to the little pig's house and said: "Little pig,
are you ready?"

"Ready!" cried the little pig. "Why, I have been to the field and
come back long ago, and now I am busy boiling a potful of turnips for
breakfast."

The wolf was very angry indeed; but he made up his mind to catch the
little pig somehow or other; so he told him that he knew where there
was a nice apple-tree.

"Where?" said the little pig.

"Round the hill in the squire's orchard," the wolf said. "So if
you will promise to play me no tricks, I will come for you tomorrow
morning at five o'clock, and we will go there together and get some
rosy-cheeked apples."

The next morning piggy got up at four o'clock and was off and away
long before the wolf came.

But the orchard was a long way off, and besides, he had the tree to
climb, which is a difficult matter for a little pig, so that before
the sack he had brought with him was quite filled he saw the wolf
coming towards him.

He was dreadfully frightened, but he thought it better to put a good
face on the matter, so when the wolf said: "Little pig, why are you
here before me? Are they nice apples?" he replied at once: "Yes, very;
I will throw down one for you to taste." So he picked an apple and
threw it so far that whilst the wolf was running to fetch it he had
time to jump down and scamper away home.

The next day the wolf came again, and told the little pig that there
was going to be a fair in the town that afternoon, and asked him if he
would go with him.

"Oh! yes," said the pig, "I will go with pleasure. What time will you
be ready to start?"

"At half-past three," said the wolf.

Of course, the little pig started long before the time, went to the
fair, and bought a fine large butter-churn, and was trotting away with
it on his back when he saw the wolf coming.

He did not know what to do, so he crept into the churn to hide, and by
so doing started it rolling.

Down the hill it went, rolling over and over, with the little pig
squeaking inside.

The wolf could not think what the strange thing rolling down the hill
could be; so he turned tail and ran away home in a fright without ever
going to the fair at all. He went to the little pig's house to tell
him how frightened he had been by a large round thing which came
rolling past him down the hill.

"Ha! ha!" laughed the little pig; "so I frightened you, eh? I had been
to the fair and bought a butter-churn; when I saw you I got inside it
and rolled down the hill."

This made the wolf so angry that he declared that he _would_ eat up
the little pig, and that nothing should save him, for he would jump
down the chimney.

But the clever little pig hung a pot full of water over the hearth
and then made a blazing fire, and just as the wolf was coming down the
chimney he took off the cover and in fell the wolf. In a second the
little pig had popped the lid on again.

Then he boiled the wolf, and ate him for supper, and after that he
lived quietly and comfortably all his days, and was never troubled by
a wolf again.

CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS




THE THREE CHILDREN

  Three children sliding on the ice
    Upon a summer's day,
  As it fell out they all fell in,
    The rest they ran away.

  Now, had these children been at home,
    Or sliding on dry ground,
  Ten thousand pounds to one penny
    They had not all been drowned.

  You parents all that children have,
    And you too that have none,
  If you would have them safe abroad
    Pray keep them safe at home.

THE OWL AND THE PUSSY-CAT


I

  The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea
    In a beautiful pea-green boat:
    They took some honey, and plenty of money
  Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
    The Owl looked up to the stars above,
  And sang to a small guitar,
    "Oh lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,
  What a beautiful Pussy you are,
             You are,
             You are!
    What a beautiful Pussy you are!"


II

  Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl,
    How charmingly sweet you sing!
  Oh! let us be married; too long we have tarried;
    But what shall we do for a ring?"
  They sailed away, for a year and a day,
    To the land where the bong-tree grows;
  And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,
    With a ring at the end of his nose,
            His nose,
            His nose,
    With a ring at the end of his nose.


III

  "Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
    Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will."
  So they took it away, and were married next day
    By the turkey who lives on the hill.
  They dined on mince and slices of quince,
    Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
  And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
    They danced by the light of the moon,
            The moon,
            The moon,
  They danced by the light of the moon.

KINDNESS TO ANIMALS

  Little children, never give
  Pain to things that feel and live:
  Let the gentle robin come
  For the crumbs you save at home,--
  As his meat you throw along
  He'll repay you with a song;
  Never hurt the timid hare
  Peeping from her green grass lair,
  Let her come and sport and play
  On the lawn at close of day;
  The little lark goes soaring high
  To the bright windows of the sky,
  Singing as if 'twere always spring,
  And fluttering on an untired wing,--
  Oh! let him sing his happy song,
  Nor do these gentle creatures wrong.

HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE

  How doth the little busy bee
    Improve each shining hour,
  And gather honey all the day
    From every opening flow'r!

  How skilfully she builds her cell!
    How neat she spreads the wax!
  And labors hard to store it well
    With the sweet food she makes.

  In works of labor or of skill,
    I would be busy too;
  For Satan finds some mischief still
    For idle hands to do.

  In books, or work, or healthful play,
    Let my first years be past,
  That I may give for ev'ry day
    Some good account at last.

SUPPOSE!

  Suppose, my little lady,
    Your doll should break her head,
  Could you make it whole by crying
    Till your eyes and nose are red?
  And wouldn't it be pleasanter
    To treat it as a joke,
  And say you're glad 'twas Dolly's,
    And not your head that broke?

  Suppose you're dressed for walking,
    And the rain comes pouring down,
  Will it clear off any sooner
    Because you scold and frown?
  And wouldn't it be nicer
    For you to smile than pout,
  And so make sunshine in the house
    When there is none without?

  Suppose your task, my little man,
    Is very hard to get,
  Will it make it any easier
    For you to sit and fret?
  And wouldn't it be wiser
    Than waiting, like a dunce,
  To go to work in earnest
    And learn the thing at once?

  Suppose that some boys have a horse,
    And some a coach and pair,
  Will it tire you less while walking
    To say, "It is n't fair?"
  And would n't it be nobler
    To keep your temper sweet,
  And in your heart be thankful
    You can walk upon your feet?

  And suppose the world don't please you,
    Nor the way some people do,
  Do you think the whole creation
    Will be altered just for you?
  And isn't it, my boy or girl,
    The wisest, bravest plan,
  Whatever comes, or does n't come,
    To do the best you can?

TWINKLE, TWINKLE

  Twinkle, twinkle, little star;
  How I wonder what you are!
  Up above the world so high,
  Like a diamond in the sky.

  When the glorious sun is set,
  When the grass with dew is wet,
  Then you show your little light,
  Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

  When the blazing sun is gone,
  When he nothing shines upon,
  Then you show your little light,
  Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

  In the dark-blue sky you keep,
  And often through my curtains peep;
  For you never shut your eye
  Till the sun is in the sky.

  As your bright and tiny spark
  Lights the traveler in the dark,
  Though I know not what you are,
  Twinkle, twinkle, little star!

PRETTY COW

  Thank you, pretty cow, that made
  Pleasant milk to soak my bread,
  Every day and every night,
  Warm, and fresh, and sweet, and white

  Do not chew the hemlock rank,
  Growing on the weedy bank;
  But the yellow cowslips eat,
  That will make it very sweet.

  Where the purple violet grows,
  Where the bubbling water flows,
  Where the grass is fresh and fine,
  Pretty cow, go there and dine.

THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS

(A CAT'S TALE, WITH ADDITIONS)

  Three little kittens lost their mittens;
      And they began to cry,
          O mother dear,
          We very much fear
      That we have lost our mittens.

      Lost your mittens!
      You naughty kittens!
    Then you shall have no pie.
          Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow.
      No, you shall have no pie.
          Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow.

  The three little kittens found their mittens,
      And they began to cry,
          O mother dear,
          See here, see here;
      See, we have found our mittens.

      Put on your mittens,
      You silly kittens,
      And you may have some pie.
          Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r,
      O let us have the pie.
          Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r.

  The three little kittens put on their mittens,
      And soon ate up the pie;
          O mother dear,
          We greatly fear
      That we have soiled our mittens.

      Soiled your mittens!
      You naughty kittens!
      Then they began to sigh,
          Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow,
      Then they began to sigh.
          Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow.

  The three little kittens washed their mittens,
      And hung them out to dry;
          O mother dear,
          Do not you hear,
      That we have washed our mittens?

      Washed your mittens!
      O, you're good kittens.
      But I smell a rat close by;
          Hush! hush! mee-ow, mee-ow.
      We smell a rat close by,
          Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow.

THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE

  When I was sick and lay a-bed,
  I had two pillows at my head,
  And all my toys beside me lay
  To keep me happy all the day.

  And sometimes for an hour or so
  I watched my leaden soldiers go,
  With different uniforms and drills,
  Among the bed-clothes, through the hills;

  And sometimes sent my ships in fleets
  All up and down among the sheets;
  Or brought my trees and houses out,
  And planted cities all about.

  I was the giant great and still
  That sits upon the pillow-hill,
  And sees before him, dale and plain,
  The pleasant land of counterpane.

THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL

  There was a little girl,
  And she had a little curl
    Right in the middle of her forehead.
  When she was good
  She was very, very good,
    And when she was bad she was horrid.

  One day she went upstairs,
  When her parents, unawares,
    In the kitchen were occupied with meals,
  And she stood upon her head
  In her little trundle-bed,
    And then began hooraying with her heels.

  Her mother heard the noise,
  And she thought it was the boys
    A-playing at a combat in the attic;
  But when she climbed the stair,
  And found Jemima there,
    She took and she did spank her most emphatic.

THE BOY WHO NEVER TOLD A LIE

  Once there was a little boy,
    With curly hair and pleasant eye--
  A boy who always told the truth,
    And never, never told a lie.

  And when he trotted off to school,
    The children all about would cry,
  "There goes the curly-headed boy--
    The boy that never tells a lie."

  And everybody loved him so,
    Because he always told the truth,
  That every day, as he grew up,
    'Twas said, "There goes the honest youth."

  And when the people that stood near
    Would turn to ask the reason why,
  The answer would be always this:
    "Because he never tells a lie."

FOREIGN CHILDREN

  Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
  Little frosty Eskimo,
  Little Turk or Japanee,
  O! don't you wish that you were me?

  You have seen the scarlet trees
  And the lions over seas;
  You have eaten ostrich eggs,
  And turned the turtles off their legs.

  Such a life is very fine,
  But it's not so nice as mine:
  You must often, as you trod,
  Have wearied _not_ to be abroad.

  You have curious things to eat,
  I am fed on proper meat;
  You must dwell beyond the foam,
  But I am safe and live at home.
    Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
    Little frosty Eskimo,
    Little Turk or Japanee,
  O! don't you wish that you were me?

THE UNSEEN PLAYMATE

  When children are playing alone on the green,
  In comes the playmate that never was seen.
  When children are happy and lonely and good,
  The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood.

  Nobody heard him and nobody saw,
  His is a picture you never could draw,
  But he's sure to be present, abroad or at home,
  When children are happy, and playing alone.

  He lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass,
  He sings when you tinkle the musical glass;
  Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why,
  The Friend of the Children is sure to be by!

  He loves to be little, he hates to be big,
  'Tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig;
  'Tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin
  That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win.

  'Tis he when at night; you go off to your bed,
  Bids you go to your sleep and not trouble your head;
  For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf,
  'Tis he will take care of your playthings himself!

I SAW THREE SHIPS

  I saw three ships come sailing in,
    On Christmas day, on Christmas day;
  I saw three ships come sailing in,
    On Christmas day in the morning.

  Pray whither sailed those ships all three
    On Christmas day, on Christmas day?
  Pray whither sailed those ships all three
    On Christmas day in the morning?

  Oh, they sailed into Bethlehem
    On Christmas day, on Christmas day;
  Oh, they sailed into Bethlehem
    On Christmas day in the morning.

  And all the bells on earth shall ring
    On Christmas day, on Christmas day;
  And all the bells on earth shall ring
    On Christmas day in the morning.

  And all the angels in heaven shall sing
    On Christmas day, on Christmas day;
  And all the angels in heaven shall sing
    On Christmas day in the morning.

  And all the souls on earth shall sing
    On Christmas day, on Christmas day;
  And all the souls on earth shall sing
    On Christmas day in the morning.
