<---------IMPORTANT------------>

1. The input must be .txt file or raw text file, this might change
2. You can add more lemma database in SL manager with configuration <"word" -> "root"> e.g. darkest	dark
3. You can add more stopwords database in SL manager
4. Full of bugs and riddled with riddle ;\
5. Use "Save to File" often. its faster. I dont know why appending String to TextBox is such pain in the a**


<---------HOW TO------------>
1. Open SL manager. Manage your stopwords and lemma databases. You can add, delete, or delete all.
2. Open File Manager. Manage your text file to be pre-processed.
3. IMPORTANT!!! Only use raw... this might change in the future if i have time.
4. Choose your formatting.. its on right-down side.
5. Choose to "Save to file" or just print to Output (Save to file recommended).
6. Pre-process
