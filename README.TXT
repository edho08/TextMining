<---------IMPORTANT------------>
"This program ain't pretty, but you are "v" " ~ INSANEPROGRAMMER


1. The input must be .txt file or raw text file, this might change
2. You can add more lemma database in SL manager with configuration <"word" -> "root"> e.g. darkest	dark
3. You can add more stopwords database in SL manager
4. Full of bugs and riddled with riddle ;\
5. Use "Save to File" often. its faster. We dont know why appending String to TextBox is such pain in the a**


<---------HOW TO------------>
1. Open SL manager. Manage your stopwords and lemma databases. You can add, delete, or delete all.
2. Open File Manager. Manage your text file to be pre-processed.
3. IMPORTANT!!! Only use raw... this might change in the future if we have time.
4. Choose your formatting.. its on right-down side.
5. Choose to "Save to file" or just print to Output (Save to file recommended).
6. Pre-process


<---------ABOUT------------>
Texty is a buggy bag of word raw text pre-processing. It is buggy as hell.

<---------TO DO------------>
- Comment the Code (All code is uncommented) (Typical)
- Add stemmer (download from internet)
- More friendly UI
- More Lemma/Stopword
- Lemma builder (for faster and ultimate lemma)
- Get some sleep
